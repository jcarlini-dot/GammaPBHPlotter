# GammaPBHPlotter
GammaPBHPlotter is a Python-coded software designed to simulate, display, and record the Hawking gamma-ray differential spectra per unit time of low-mass (10¹⁴-10¹⁸ g) primordial black holes in MeV⁻¹s⁻¹. These spectra include direct hawking radiation, secondary decay, final state bremsstrahlung radiation, and inflight positron annihilation.
